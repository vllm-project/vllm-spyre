**IBM Spyre** is the first production-grade Artificial Intelligence Unit (AIU) accelerator born out of the IBM Research AIU family, and is part of a long-term strategy of developing novel architectures and full-stack technology solutions for the emerging space of generative AI. Spyre builds on the foundation of IBM‚Äôs internal AIU research and delivers a scalable, efficient architecture for accelerating AI in enterprise environments.

The vLLM Spyre plugin (`vllm-spyre`) is a dedicated backend extension that enables seamless integration of IBM Spyre Accelerator with vLLM. It follows the architecture described in [vLLM's Plugin System](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/latest/design/plugin_system.html), making it easy to integrate IBM's advanced AI acceleration into existing vLLM workflows.
