"""Spyre-specific RMSNorm implementation using out-of-tree (OOT) registration.

This module provides a custom RMSNorm layer for IBM's Spyre device,
replacing the upstream vLLM implementation (vllm/model_executor/layers/layernorm.py)
when instantiated.

Architecture:
    - OOT Registration: @RMSNorm.register_oot() replaces upstream at instantiation
    - forward_oot(): Entry point for OOT dispatch, calls _forward_spyre_impl
      directly (no custom op boundary needed since Spyre does not support
      in-device tensor copy)
    - Separate Compilation: forward_spyre is compiled independently via maybe_compile

Spyre Device Constraints:
    - Minimum batch size: 64 (due to spyre constraint, automatically padded)
    - Device dtype: float16 (converted for CPU)
    - Output dtype: bfloat16 (converted on CPU)
    - Algorithm: Transpose-based computation with torch.ops.spyre.full()

Limitations:
    Currently the implementation in `forward_spyre` is similar to the
    upstream implementation in `forward_static` from vllm/model_executor/layers/layernorm.py,
    but it DOES NOT use the promotion of the data types, as this is not
    yet supported in torch-spyre.
