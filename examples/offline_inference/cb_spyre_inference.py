    "The world’s most lucrative education prizes will be awarded next year for the first time and nominations are now being accepted. Launched by Tencent co-founder “Charles” Chen Yidan, the Yidan Prize will be given to individuals who make significant contributions toward tackling big challenges in education. The winners will be announced in September and the award ceremony will be held next December in Hong Kong. Recipients of each of the two awards, the Yidan Prize for Education Research and the Yidan Prize for Education Development, will get HK$15 million (US$1.9 million) in cash and HK$15 million to pursue their projects. Chen made a trip to the U.S. in early September to encourage a discussion on the future of education and seek candidates for the prizes at universities such as Harvard, Columbia, Stanford and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. “We engaged in good conversations and they (the American universities and education institutions he visited) have nominated qualified candidates,” he says. “I was excited to find that they were passionate about education, just like me.” The biggest challenge facing the Yidan Prize in the next year? To select the two winners. “I am going to pass that hard task to the selecting committee,” he says. Can you summarize the Yidan Prize and its purpose, as well as the amount of cash prize that will be given to the recipients?", # noqa: E501
