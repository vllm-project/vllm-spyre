"""Regression test: a grammar-pending request must not stall in-flight decodes.

vLLM's scheduler ships structured-output requests through a separate queue
(``self.skipped_waiting``) precisely so they can sit there with their FSM
still compiling without holding up the main waiting queue. The Spyre
``ChunkedPrefillSpyreScheduler`` drains both ``waiting`` and
``skipped_waiting`` into its own holdback each iteration to enforce its
one-prefill-at-a-time invariant — so it now owns the responsibility of
treating grammar-pending requests correctly.

If the Spyre scheduler does NOT filter grammar-pending requests after the
holdback pass, then whenever such a request sits in the queue the scheduler
hides the running decodes to switch to prefill mode but ``super().schedule()``
can't actually prefill the request — its FSM isn't ready. The result is
alternating "stalled" and "decode" steps that halve throughput for every
other request behind the structured one.

This test verifies that the unstructured requests in front of a
grammar-pending structured request continue to decode on every scheduler
step until they finish, and that once the grammar is signalled ready the
structured request can then start prefilling and producing tokens.

The test only interacts with the runner's public methods
(``execute_new_request`` / ``execute_running_requests``) and reads per-step
progress via the returned ``ModelRunnerOutput``. The grammar's readiness is
gated on a ``threading.Event`` so the test can deterministically drive both
phases — pending grammar, then signalled.
